# 📦 Batch Ingestion Considerations: Designing for Scale and Simplicity

In a world obsessed with real-time streams and microsecond latencies, it's easy to overlook the enduring value of **batch processing**. But the truth is — **batch ingestion still powers the backbone of modern data infrastructure**, especially when it comes to data lakes, warehousing, and enterprise analytics.

Whether you're extracting transactional data from OLTP systems or persisting streaming outputs into cold storage, understanding how to design **efficient, reliable batch ingestion** pipelines is key to scaling your data platform.

In this post, we’ll break down the core considerations for batch ingestion, the most common patterns, and key pitfalls to avoid.

---

## ⏱️ Time vs 📏 Size-Based Ingestion

Batch ingestion is usually triggered in one of two ways: **based on time intervals** or **the size of accumulated data**.

### ⌛ Time-Based Batch Ingestion

This is the most traditional pattern — running ETL jobs at fixed intervals like hourly, daily, or weekly.

> 🏢 Common in enterprise data warehousing, where reports are generated daily (e.g., overnight during off-hours).

✅ **Pros**:
- Predictable
- Simple to schedule and monitor

⚠️ **Cons**:
- Can delay availability of fresh data
- May reprocess unchanged data

---

### 📦 Size-Based Batch Ingestion

Here, ingestion is triggered once a certain volume of data has accumulated — often used in streaming systems that dump data into object storage like S3 or GCS.

> 🌀 For example, data from Kafka may be batched every 100MB before writing to Parquet files in a data lake.

✅ **Pros**:
- Reduces small file problems
- More efficient for object storage

⚠️ **Cons**:
- Harder to predict ingestion frequency
- Potential data freshness delays under low volume

---

## 🧩 Common Batch Ingestion Patterns

Let’s look at a few design patterns that are frequently used when building batch pipelines.

---

### 📸 1. Snapshot vs Differential (Incremental) Extraction

- **Snapshot Extraction**: Pull the *entire dataset* each time.
- **Incremental Extraction**: Only pull *new or updated records* since the last run.

> 💡 Use incremental ingestion wherever possible to reduce data volume and processing time.

🧠 **Remember**: Incremental approaches need robust tracking mechanisms (e.g., `updated_at` timestamps or CDC logs).

---

### 📁 2. File-Based Export & Ingestion

Data is often moved between systems via exported files (CSV, Parquet, Avro). This is a **push-based** pattern — the source system exports the data, and the destination ingests it.

🔐 **Benefits**:
- **Security**: No direct DB access required
- **Control**: Source defines the export logic
- **Flexibility**: Files can be distributed via SFTP, EDI, SCP, etc.

> 📦 Especially valuable when dealing with legacy systems or B2B integrations.

---

### 🔄 3. ETL vs ELT

These two approaches define *where* the transformation logic lives.

- **ETL** (Extract → Transform → Load): Data is cleaned before loading.
- **ELT** (Extract → Load → Transform): Raw data is loaded, then transformed downstream (e.g., in Snowflake, BigQuery).

⚖️ **Trade-offs**:
- ETL gives more control over data quality upfront
- ELT is easier to scale in modern cloud warehouses with powerful compute

> 🧠 Choose ELT when storage is cheap and transformation can be deferred or done in SQL.

---

### 🧮 4. Inserts, Updates, and Batch Size

Batch size **significantly** impacts ingestion performance.

🚫 **Bad**: Writing one row at a time  
✅ **Good**: Ingesting data in large, compressed batches

📊 Especially in **columnar stores** (like Snowflake, BigQuery, Redshift):
- Small writes → Many tiny, inefficient files
- Frequent updates → Costly table scans and compaction

> 🔍 Understand your target system’s write and update patterns before building your pipeline.

---

### 🔄 5. Data Migration

Moving data between systems (e.g., PostgreSQL → Snowflake) sounds simple… until you're migrating **terabytes**.

🛠️ **Best practices**:
- Start with **sample ingestion** to uncover schema mismatches
- Use object storage as a **staging layer** (e.g., dump to S3 → load into target)
- Prefer bulk operations for better performance

⚠️ **Biggest challenge** isn't data transfer — it's **reconnecting all your downstream pipelines** to the new system.

> 🚚 Use specialized tools like **AWS DMS, Fivetran, dbt, Airbyte, or custom scripts** to streamline migration.

---

## 🧠 Final Thoughts

Batch ingestion may not be trendy, but it's **critical infrastructure** — especially in systems that prioritize consistency, cost-efficiency, and scale. Whether you’re building from scratch or modernizing a legacy setup, understanding the trade-offs of each pattern will save you time, money, and painful rework down the line.

🔁 **Key takeaways**:
- Choose the right trigger: time vs size
- Prefer incremental over full loads
- Avoid small batch writes
- Use file-based ingestion when security or decoupling is important
- Plan migrations thoroughly — the pipelines are as important as the data
